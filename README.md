# Mundo dos As

## What is the project about

More or less a year a go I decided to embark in a project that consisted in building my nieces website for promoting they first youtube channel. 
At the time, I simply used vanilla web technologies and didn't really have a workflow development in place. But here I am! Willing to rebuild the website, so hopefully it will look a little better. This time I am using React.js and Tailwind css, plus Vite which brings up a nice development environment and workflow.
